// PT_GUARDED_BY is similar, but is intended for use on pointers and smart
// pointers. There is no constraint on the data member itself, but the data
// that it points to is protected by the given capability.

// REQUIRES is an attribute on functions or methods, which declares that the
// calling thread must have exclusive access to the given capabilities. More

// to the function, and must still be held on exit.
// REQUIRES_SHARED is similar, but requires only shared access.
